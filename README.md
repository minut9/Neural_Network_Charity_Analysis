# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

An exercise for Deep Learning and Neural Networks, utilizing pandas libraries in Python and TensorFlow to process data and produce a predictive binary classifier.

## Overview
  The end goal of this project was to explore and implement neural networks using TensorFlow in Python. Neural Networks is a form of Machine Learning that cna search and find patterns and particular features in a dataset. This type of learning is modeled after a brain which has many layers of neurons. As information goes in through the layers, the information is pushed through identifying features into the final output of data. A good analogy would be a car wash. Dirty car goes in and after multiple layers of cleaning, water, waxing, and drying - the car comes out clean as a final product.
